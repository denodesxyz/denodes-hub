Welcome to this research, where you will find detailed information about the Namada architecture, team, and backers, resources, and testnet. In the following sections, we will explore each of these aspects in more detail, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## What is Shardeum

[<mark style="color:blue;">Shardeum</mark>](http://shardeum.org/) is a blockchain platform that focuses on developing smart contracts. It offers low gas fees, full decentralization, and robust data protection through dynamic partitioning. [<mark style="color:blue;">Shardeum</mark>](https://twitter.com/shardeum) is compatible with EVM and aims to address scalability, security, and decentralization challenges for EVM-based decentralized applications.

{% hint style="info" %}
[<mark style="color:blue;">EVM</mark>](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) is the runtime for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to run smart contract code by compiling it to EVM bytecode.
{% endhint %}

The blockchain startup uses Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Quorum consensus mechanisms to reduce the cost of network operation and relies on three types of nodes - validators, archivers, and backup nodes.

Shardeum expects its blockchain to process over 100,000 transactions per second with 100,000 nodes and have a latency of up to 10 seconds. It also aims to provide more flexibility for Ethereum developers to migrate to Shardeum and maintain stable gas fees, which are currently very high on the Ethereum network.

## SHM, Native Coin

The Shardeum network will have a native coin called Shard (SHM). The coin will be mined by validators, archive nodes, and standby nodes as a reward for providing resources to the network. It will be used to pay gas fees for transfer transactions and smart contract execution on the Shardeum network.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Max supply:** 508 million SHM.
{% endhint %}

* 51% Community - rewards to nodes (validators, archive nodes, and standby servers)
* 18% Sale - 3-month cliff, then 2 years of linear vesting
* 15% Team - 3-month cliff, then 2 years of linear vesting
* 11% Foundation - unlocked at Token Generation Event (TGE)
* 5% Ecosystem & Airdrops - unlocked at TGE

## Roadmap

Although Shardeum was started in early 2022, Shardus, the protocol-level technology being used in Shardeum, has been in design and development since 2016. Shardus is a framework for creating linearly scalable distributed ledgers. Shardeum will obtain a public project license for the Shardus framework by allowing Shardus token holders to claim 1% of the max supply.&#x20;

* **Q2 2022** - Alphanet
* **Q3 2022** - Betanet
* **Q4 2023** - Mainnet
* **Q1 2024** - Token Launch
