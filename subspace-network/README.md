## Installation

```
wget -O subspace.sh https://github.com/denodesxyz/denodes-hub/raw/hub/scripts/subspace.sh && chmod +x subspace.sh && ./subspace.sh
```

If the text "Illegal instruction" appears during installation, it means that the processor is not suitable for this version. You can try adding the "v2" parameter and install the version for older processors:

```
wget -O subspace.sh https://github.com/denodesxyz/denodes-hub/raw/hub/scripts/subspace.sh && chmod +x subspace.sh && ./subspace.sh v2
```

During the installation process, several parameters will be requested, the most important of which are the wallet address, the node name and the volume of the disk allocated for the plot.

For the first question, enter Y ![Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 18 03 36](https://github.com/denodesxyz/denodes-hub/assets/139079136/33aa294e-7995-43b8-aa80-12356dfe8adc)

Enter the address that can be taken here: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc-0.gemini-3e.subspace.network%2Fws#/accounts or install recommended wallet [Subwallet](https://docs.subspace.network/docs/protocol/wallets/subwallet) ![Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 18 06 35](https://github.com/denodesxyz/denodes-hub/assets/139079136/9d4d4602-3bfd-4904-ad67-7bece619fa43)

Specify the paths for storing the plot and the node data (you can leave the default values): ![Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 18 07 25](https://github.com/denodesxyz/denodes-hub/assets/139079136/dfa79cd4-f47b-41a1-9eb8-b140a9d59ffb)

## Monitoring

Viewing logs:

```
journalctl -f -u subspace-node -o cat
```

In addition to logs, you can find your node in telemetry. Keep in mind that with a large number of farmers, there is a chance that even a successfully working node will not be seen in telemetry immediately. To search, you just need to start typing the node name. Clicking on the row with the node pin it to the top of the list.
